    "### Introduction\n",
    "When a society faces unusual challenges, it often leads to major cultural shifts and realizations. COVID-19, which has impacted the global society in unpredictable and significant ways, stands as an opportunity for data scientists to gain insight into the nuances of healthcare, labor, and economics. By analyzing information from the CDC's database on COVID-19 related deaths, information from the United States Census Bureau, as well as data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, our team hopes to shed light on whether or not a state's overall socioeconomic breakdown influenced their COVID-19 mortality rate in 2020. Our macroscopic approach to this data science problem is motivated by the availability of consistent and state-specific data. We additionally propose a predictive model in the form of a function which uses the analyzed trends to make a prediction based on two hypothetical values: a specifed median income and % of population without healthcare. \n",

    "### Prior Work\n",
    "An health policy article by Adhikari, S. et. Al [1] discussed the early impact of COVID-19 based on a city's income level and race/ethnicity data. Their paper focused on ten major cities and discovered a positive correlation between lower income, more diverse areas and an increase in COVID-19 death and infection rates. According to an American Medical Association review of Adhikari's publication, there is \"no biological or genetic basis for why these inequities would exist\". While this article suggests an important relationship between income, race, and COVID-19 impact, our research team wishes to better understand this relationship on a state-level scale. This macroscopic approach has also been deemed meaningful by larger organizations such as the NIH, as expressed in a 2020 publication from the Journal of General Internal Medicine [2]. The researchers in this study used the Gini index as their measurement of income inequality. They acknowledge that income levels may be representative of a state's healthcare resources and number of essential occupations, but we believe that by directly analyzing health insurance and labor statistics in our research will paint a clearer picture of what previous scientists have already suggested.\n",
