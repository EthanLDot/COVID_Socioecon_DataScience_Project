    "## Dataset 1 (COVID)\n",
    "- With the imported data, we removed unncessary states. We only want the 50 states not including territories or DC\n",
    "- We then removed the columns that we didn't need for analysis. We did this by selecting the columns that we needed\n",
    "- We also wanted the dates to appear in a sortable/searchable way, so we made the dates arranged in yyyy-mm-dd format\n",
    "- The data was then saved as a csv file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Since the data is arranged by date, we created a function ```read_covid_data``` that will return the 50 states with their respective data for just that specified date\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset 2 (Labor)\n",
    "- The raw data file for Dataset 2 is an excel file. The format of the data was not organized in a way that complements dataframes, so we had a lot of unnecessary texts in the excel\n",
    "read as data entries as well. \n",
    "- Our first step was to identify the columns and rows that we want, which are the 50 states. We removed unnecessary states (including U.S. territories) and removed all the extra\n",
    "non-state entries that were read as rows.\n",
    "- Another problem is that some names in the State column had some footnote numbers that were unintentionally read from the excel sheet. We solved this by removing all occurences of numbers and parentheses from the State column.\n",
    "- Since other datasets use state codes and the original data uses state names, we had to transform state names in the States column to their corresponding state codes. We did this by defining a function ```to_state_code``` that uses a dictionary to map each state name to their state code.\n",
    "- We had to reorganize the structure of the dataframe, as the original file had the data stacked on top of each other so each state had 3 rows in the Dataframe. We did so by separating the \n",
    "raw dataframe into three different dataframes, and then combining them into a single dataframe so we only have 50 rows.\n",
    "- We then removed unnessary columns, such as data from other time periods (Our focus was December of 2020). We also combined the columns of job sectors into two groups relevant to our analysis: Blue collar (construction, mining, trade, leisure) and White collar (Financial, professional, education, government) jobs.\n",
    "- Our final step for Dataset 3 is to export the cleaned dataset as a csv and save it to the \"Cleaned Data\" folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset 3 (Income/Insurance)\n",
    "- For Dataset 3, we have two primary steps in cleaning the data. The first step was manually inputting the data from the data sources to a CSV file via Google Sheets. This manual step was necessary due to the fact that the original data source did not have an option to directly extract/download the raw data. Since there were only 50 observations, we decided manual input was the best option. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Our second step for Dataset 3 was to import the data into this notebook. We uploaded the CSV file into our \"Raw Data\" folder, and then used read_csv to bring it into a dataframe, which is a usable format for our future analysis. After making sure there were no issues, we then saved it to the \"Cleaned Data\" folder."
