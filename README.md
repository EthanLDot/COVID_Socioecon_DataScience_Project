# COVID Infections/Deaths and State Socioeconomic Conditions

A quantitative analysis using real-world data to determine if the macroscopic socioeconomic status of a state has a correlation to COVID infection and mortality rates in 2020-2021. Used pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn Python libraries.

### Full report can be read in index.ipynb. Raw data, cleaned data, all python code used, and previous notebooks used in the project are all accessible in this repository.

Created by Stephen Kim, Ethan Lee, Ernest Lin, Wesley Nguyen, and Clara Yi (all of the University of California, San Diego) for COGS 108 Winter 2022. Completed March 2022.

Apologies for the "This notebook took too long to render" issue upon opening index.ipynb, the Jupyter notebook came out pretty big in filesize. Refresh the page if this occurs.
